## Welcome to my mini project!
This simple mini project called Ordering Snack, provides two options to order, written in C Programming Language it's a perfect project for implementing simple idea with C I hope you get an ideal order :)

## Tools:
    1. C
    2. Implemented by Code Blocks

## The idea of the project:
It has 3 options 
1. Customer option.
2. About The Project 
3. Exit

There are three options, for option 1. for order, view order, and Back to the main menu.
There are three options, for option 2. You can order fries or/and a burger, order again, or get your total price. then you need to enter your data.

## Brief
At the beginning of the code, we provided 4 different (headers) once you add the headers file to your program you can use all the functions including scanf(), printf(), and others as well

Then we have 5 different functions:

    --1. The first function is called mainmenu this function is responsible for displaying the menu and then getting from the user which option they choose and based on their choices             there's an if statement, 

        if the user selects 1 then the Customer() function is called,        
        if the user selects 2, the aboutproject() function well called which likely displays information about the project 
        lastly, if the user selects 3 then the screen will be clear again and a thank message will display and exit the program

    --2. The second function is called customer(); this function provides ording snacks it lets the users 
        1. order snacks,
        2. view their orders, 
        3. or return to the main menu, 
        it also includes the loading process

    --3. The third function is called osanck(); this function handles the snack ordering process it displays the snack menu, lets the user input their order, and then calculates the               total price, it's also provides for you to order again or to get your total price

    --4. The fourth function is straightforward it collects personal information from the users that contains their first names, second names, phone numbers
    
    --5. The fifth function is called aboutprojet() this function provides a brief description of the project, After displaying the message it waits for the user to enter any key to               return them to the main menu

## Welcome to my mini project!
This simple mini project called Ordering Snack, provides two options to order, written in C Programming Language it's a perfect project for implementing simple idea with C I hope you get an ideal order :)

## Tools:
    1. C
    2. Implemented by Code Blocks

## The idea of the project:
It has 3 options 
1. Customer option.
2. About The Project 
3. Exit
There are three options, for option 1. for order, view order, and Back to the main menu.
There are three options, for option 2. You can order fries or/and a burger, order again, or get your total price. then you need to enter your data.

## Brief
At the beginning of the code, we provided 4 different headers to give access to a variety of built-in functions like printf(), malloc(), getch(), and sleep(), to simplify common programming task

Then we have 5 different functions:

    --1. The first function is this function called mainmenu, which guides the user to three different choices and each choice has an order for example if the user chooses 1 then the second function is customer();

    --2. the second function is related to the first function is that if the user enters 1 then the second function will work and ask the user to order to view the order or to go to the main menu.

    --3. and then the third function responsible for your order 1. Fries or 2. Burger or 3. to go to the main menu and when you order it's responsible for whatever quantity you want to order and lastly it calculates your total

    --4. include your personal information including first name, second name, and phone number

    -5. this last function is about the project.st function is that if the user enters 1 then the second function will work and ask the user to order to view the order or to go to the main menu.

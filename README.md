## Welcome to my mini project!
    This simple mini project called Ordering Snack, provides two options to order, written in C Programming Language it's a perfect project for implementing simple idea with C I hope you get an ideal order :)

## Tools:
    1. C
    2. Implemented by Code Blocks

## The idea of the project:
    First of all It uppers 3 options for 1. Customer Section, for 2. About The Project and 3. Exit, Then if we press 1 for Customer Section then we will have three options, the first one for order then for view order and lastly Back to the main menu if we enter order then there are also options one for fries and one for a burger and lastly for back to the main menu and then when you order you can order again or get your total and then you entered your personal details..

## pref
    At the beginning of the code, we provided 4 different headers to give access to a variety of built-in functions like printf(), malloc(), getch(), and sleep(), to simplify common programming task
